I change cities 
I represent the area - I have a repertoire 
Never asked, but always got it somewhere
The more money, the more I like Moscow 
But in St. Petersburg there is a soul, in St. Petersburg there is a family
In St. Petersburg there are brothers, they know our names there
This is the second album, the second chapter
I didn’t think, I didn’t guess, all I did was rap
The underground is not bros in threadbare pants
You need to live my life to compose like me 
You need to hear my rap to understand it for sure
